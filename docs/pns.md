<summary><b>🔽 Neuron Basics & Structure⭐️</b></summary>

  - Neuron = functional unit of nervous system/nerve cells  
  - Soma (cell body) → protein synthesis, nucleus, organelles  
  - Dendrites → main input branches, receive graded potentials, project from soma  
  - Axon → output, arises at axon hillock (trigger zone)  
  - Presynaptic terminal → releases neurotransmitter into synaptic cleft/end of axon to target cell  

- **Cytoskeleton & Transport**  
  - Anterograde (soma → terminal) → kinesin, ATP  
  - Retrograde (terminal → soma) → dynein, ATP

<summary><b>🧩 Neuron Types</b></summary>

- **Unipolar**  
  - Single process; most sensory neurons (touch, pain).  

- **Bipolar**  
  - One dendrite + one axon; retina, olfactory epithelium, inner ear.  

- **Multipolar**  
  - Many dendrites + one axon; most common (motor neurons, interneurons).  

- **Pseudounipolar**  
  - Single process splits into two branches; DRG sensory neurons.  

- **Interneurons**  
  - Short local connections within CNS; integration and reflex arcs.

<summary><b>🔽 Synapses & Potentials⭐️</b></summary>
  
⭐️ Same chemical & electrical interaction

- **Electrical synapses**
  - Direct ionic spread via gap junctions  
  - Very fast, synchronous (e.g., brainstem respiratory nuclei)  

- **Chemical synapses**
  - Majority of synapses in the nervous system  
  - Neurotransmitters cross the synaptic cleft  
  - Target of most drugs, toxins, and diseases  

- **Postsynaptic Potentials**  
  - ⭐️Excitatory (EPSP): Na+ / Ca2+ influx → depolarization (closer to fire) 
  - ⭐️Inhibitory (IPSP): Cl− influx or K+ efflux → hyperpolarization (harder to fire)
  - In hyperpolarization (potential dips below rest/becomes more negative  (eg. –80 mV) before returning to rest/less negative/-70mV) 
  - ⭐️More Ca2+ = more NT release; less Ca2+ = less NT release  

- **AP Phases⭐️**  
  1. Depolarization (with signal) less negative: Na⁺ & Ca⁺ influx (+35 mV peak membrane potential)  
    - Na⁺ inactivation  
  2. Repolarization: K⁺ efflux or Cl− influx

- **Resting potential**
  - ⭐️~ –70 mV (maintained by Na⁺/K⁺ ATPase → 3 Na⁺ out, 2 K⁺ in)  

- **Threshold**
  - ⭐️~ –55 mV → Na⁺ channels open  (no action potential if not met)

- **Refractory Periods⭐️**  
  - Absolute → no AP possible (Na+ channels inactivated)  
  - Relative → stronger stimulus needed  
  - Function: forward-only propagation  

- **Conduction⭐️**  
  - Unmyelinated → continuous regeneration  
  - Myelinated → saltatory (nodes of Ranvier) → faster, energy-efficient  
  - CNS demyelination = multiple sclerosis  
  - PNS demyelination = Guillain-Barré

<summary><b>🔽 Information Flow⭐️</b></summary>

- ⭐️Afferent neurons → carry sensory info to CNS  
- ⭐️Efferent neurons → carry motor commands from CNS
- ⭐️SAME / DAVE:
  - Sensory = Afferent, Motor = Efferent.
  - Dorsal = Afferent, Ventral = Efferent. 
- Interneurons → local connectors for integration  
- Divergence → one axon branches to many targets  
- Convergence → multiple inputs onto one target neuron
- Summation (integration of local potentials):
- Spatial summation → multiple inputs from different presynaptic neurons arrive at different places simultaneously and combine at the axon hillock.
- Temporal summation → one presynaptic neuron fires multiple times in rapid succession, overlapping to add together.
  Together they determine if threshold is reached and AP occurs.
- ⭐️Propagation of action potentials:
  Faster with larger axon diameter and myelination.
